This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP date comparisons.  The code attempts to check if today's date is equal to tomorrow's date.  Due to PHP's string comparison of dates, the comparison fails to produce the expected output. The solution showcases a robust approach using timestamps for accurate date comparisons.
